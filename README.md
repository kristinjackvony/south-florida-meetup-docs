The JSON files for the Restful Booker collection and environment used in my presentation

Thanks for attending my presentation on Postman Assertions for Automated API Testing!  

This repo contains just two files: 

restfulbooker.collection.json- this is the collection of all of the Postman requests in the test collection
restfulbooker.environment.json- this is the environment file with the variables needed to run the collection

Download these files, and then you can upload them into Postman to look at all the different assertions I used.

You can then run the tests with the Collection Runner, or you can use the newman command to run them from the command line.

In addition to these files, you may also want to look at my slide deck: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hJ0LGe_jaqBP1k2sNlz7d0ZSkh_Nsi6-QbZ4o6QxjXQ/edit?usp=sharing

Happy Testing!
